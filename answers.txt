What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
    gitignore is used to ignore few directories or files from the project to avoid committing into the source code repository. Often, our compiler generated outputs and optimizations doesnt need to be part of our repo, so we put those directories in gitignore.

# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
  when the commit which we are trying to merge is directly ahead of the previous commit in the destination branch, then git just moves the head pointer to the new commit, and there will be no merge commit.

Why should you have different branches?
 1. Easy to develop new features OR to fix bug
 2. Allows simultaneous/parallel development in a team environment
 3. To experiment something new
 4. To test/reproduce/fix a bug in a particular version

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
    Usally, one or two repositories.
    In case of web-based projects, we can have one repo for client side and another one for server side. 
    Sometimes we might have some additional repositories if we are making a part of our project as open-source. 
    In mobile projects, we can have mulitple repositories if multiple sdk's are built by different teams for a single product.
